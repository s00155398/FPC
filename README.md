This video Showcases the gameplay utilizing the weapons available to the player currently, the assault rifle and the pistol. It also shows the interaction between the placeholder enemy characters and the projectiles that the weapons produce. Currently this interaction consists of if the projectile collides with the mesh of the enemy character then said characters are rendered into a ragdoll state to simulate death or injury.
